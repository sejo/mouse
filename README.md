# Mouse

## Name

In the factual history book of Douglas Adams, The hitchikers guide to the galaxy, the mice are the gatherers of information and calculators for the problem "The answer to life, universe and everything".
Hence mouse :D.

## Whut?

Mouse is a rust based facts gatherer that returns a list of facts of the host, it can be completely ran as user at this time and it's intended to stay that way.
Mouse does not alter the system, just gathers information and returns it in a key/value way (with extra epoch timestamp).

## Why?

Yes we have ohai, facter, osquery,... 
But those won't let me learn Rust. 

## Contribute?

Why not, but don't feel obligated.

## I have more questions:
